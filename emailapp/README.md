= Encryptomail::EmailApp

* We assume that an SMTP email server is available - such as PostFix. 
    * Set-up, configuration, and Administration are outside the scope of this software. 
    * Take neccessary precautions to insure that your server instance is secure enough to host a service of this nature.
